# django-simple-website

My first Django project was a simple example business website.

I have created Sidebar using Bootstrap 4 with CSS and jQuery.
On the sidebar menu, you can see sections like:

- Home
- About
- Galleries
- FAQ
- Contact

When you click on Home, two sections unfold :

- News - I have created something like a blog section, with the ability to add news from the Django admin panel.
- News API - where the news are generated by News API. (JSON-based REST API for searching and retrieving news articles from all over the web)

When you click on Galleries, you will see two sections too :

- Gallery - for regular pictures.
- 360 degree - for 360 degree pictures. 

Both controlled from Django admin panel. 360 degree gallery I have created with an A-Frame (A web framework for building virtual reality experiences)

In this project I didn't focus to make the webpage looks great (HTML/CSS), my point was to focus on developing functionalities as News/News API and 360 degree gallery
