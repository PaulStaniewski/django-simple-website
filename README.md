My first Django project is a simple business website.

I have create Sidebar using Bootstrap 4 with CSS and jQuery.
On the sidebar u have option like:

- Home
- About
- Galleries
- Faq
- Contact

When you click on Home, 2 options unfolds:

- News - i have create something like a blog section, with the ability to add news from the django admin panel.
- NewsAPI - where the news are generated by News API. ( JSON-based REST API for searching and retrieving news articles from all over the web )

When you click on Galleries, you have aswell two options.

- Gallery - for normal pictures.
- 360degree - for 360 degree pictures. 

Both controlled from django admin panel. 360degree gallery i done with A-Frame ( A web framework for building virtual reality experiences )
